I'm now mastered [Intro to HTML/CSS: Making webpages][khan-course] in Khan Academy. So, next step is to add a theme to style this blog with CSS. In this [page][khan-course-page], it provided some tips and I will use it to have my blog looks more pretty.

First, pick a palette from [Paletton][paletton]. It's really convenient for user to just move a dot in outter ring to a color you'd like. Then move indicator in middle circle to get a palette. For example, I like green a lot. And this is [the pallete][the-palette] I'm going to use.

I'm really not a art-man. So I decide to not only use the pallete from Paletton, but also learn how to layout a website. Plus what I learned from Khan Academy, I know how to view source of a page. You could put "view-source:http://paletton.com/examples/webpage/index-white.html" in URL bar of chrome browser to know how the example page named each block of a site, e.g. header, menu, content, and footer...,etc. I'm going to take a snapshot of my current site and you could compare later when I make CSS work. 

![Original Blog Appearance]({{site.baseurl}}/images/OriginalStyle.png){:width="400px"}

Now, it looks better. Probably could be improved after I learn more. Stay tuned.
